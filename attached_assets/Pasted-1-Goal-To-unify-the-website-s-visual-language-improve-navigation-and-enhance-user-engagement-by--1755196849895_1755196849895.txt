1. Goal

To unify the website’s visual language, improve navigation, and enhance user engagement by modernizing legacy-styled pages (Management, About, Quality) so they match the clean, structured design used in the Products, Services, and Facility pages.

2. Pages Targeted for Redesign

About Us (/about)

Management (/about/management)

Dr. Robert T. Yorke (/about/robert-yorke)

Quality Management (/quality)

News (/about/news)

Homepage (minor adjustments for branding consistency)

3. Redesign Approach
A. Visual Consistency

Current issue:
Older pages use beige backgrounds, box borders, and dated typography that break the flow of the site.

Planned changes:

Replace beige background with the white/very-light grey background used in modern sections.

Increase section padding (top/bottom) to match Services & Products pages.

Use consistent card/grid layout for people, policies, and history — like the “Featured Projects” grid style.

Ensure all headings follow H1/H2 styling from modern pages (e.g., bold, sans-serif, left-aligned).

B. Page-by-Page Updates
About Us

Convert “Company Profile” into two-column layout:
Left = image, Right = text.
Add corporate background image banner at top like Services/Products.

Combine “Our History” and “Our Excellence” into a timeline or milestone section with year markers.

Move “Board of Directors” and “Management Team” into clickable cards linking to bios (same style as project tiles).

Management

Use alternating left/right image and bio blocks (photo on one side, text on the other) for better flow.

Break long bios into sections: Role & Responsibilities, Career Highlights, Qualifications, Achievements.

Add company-branded accent icons (briefcase, award, diploma) before each section.

Standardize image sizes and use circular or soft-rounded style to modernize.

Dr. Robert T. Yorke

Merge Early Life & Education with Career Foundation into a single “Career Journey” section.

Replace beige background with the modern full-width white style.

Use horizontal timeline for “Business Ventures & Expansion” with thumbnail images.

Move “Awards & Recognition” into card format with icons for each achievement.

Quality Management

Split into expandable accordion sections:

Quality Policy

HSE Management Policy

The BSI Group

Commitment to Excellence

Add relevant iconography for each section.

Replace dense text blocks with shorter paragraphs and bullet lists for readability.

News

Convert to blog-style cards with image, date, headline, and “Read More” link.

Use a three-column responsive grid layout like “Featured Projects”.

C. Homepage Adjustments

Add mission statement overlay on hero slider images.

Ensure latest projects/news appear as clickable cards.

Use the modern call-to-action bar from Facility page across all CTAs.

D. Navigation & Usability

Add breadcrumb navigation on all subpages.

Make header/logo clickable to return to homepage.

Enable sticky header so menu stays visible on scroll.

Cross-link related content (e.g., from Services → Products, from Projects → Facility).

E. Branding Enhancements

Use consistent corporate orange accents for buttons, hover effects, and headings.

Introduce subtle animated hover effects on cards for interactivity.

Standardize button shapes and sizes (rounded corners, solid fill).

F. SEO & Accessibility

Add unique meta descriptions and page titles for each page.

Ensure alt text for all images.

Implement schema markup for:

Organization

Product

Project

Person (for management profiles)

Improve internal linking between related services, products, and projects.

4. Implementation Sequence
