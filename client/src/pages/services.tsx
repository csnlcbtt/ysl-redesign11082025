All computers at Yorke Structures are networked and the company has a web site on the Internet and operates e-mail facilities. The drawing office boasts eight networked computer workstations running StruCAD 3D modeling and AutoCAD software. 3D structures are modeled and all connections applied and detailed using StruCAD software. The software has the capability to perform dimensional and other clash checks and automatically generates error-free detailed shop drawings. Each workstation is linked to enable the sharing of standard details and other project information and all are connected to central plotter and back up facilities. The company's bid and tender development, engineering design and project management capabilities have all been streamlined Using proprietary software solutions",

The company operates three large saw benches. All plating, drilling and assembly work is carried out by skilled fitters and inspected in accordance with the requirements of the company Quality System. All welding is carried out by qualified welders, who are regularly tested and certified in specific welding skills in accordance with recognised international standards. Welding is usually carried out using automatic MIG welding machines although other welding methods can be readily accommodated. Non-destructive testing of welds, when required, is arranged through an external testing agency. The company operates two inclined 8-wheel BCP Wheelabrator machines which are capable of blasting steelwork to near white (SSPC SP10) in a single pass. All blast profiles from a commercial blast to a near white steel condition can be achieved. In addition a manual blasting shop is available to blast larger structural components. The company operates both an automatic painting machine and a large ventilated paint shop and can apply all specified paint systems. Ambient conditions are measured and recorded to ensure manufacturer's instructions are complied with and clients' expectations are met.",
